# HAQAE
Hierarchical And Quantized AutoEncoders 

Code for the EMNLP 2018 paper "Hierarchical Quantized Representations for Script Generation"

A quick note: The model in the paper is called HAQAE, however, for whatever reason, during development the model was called DAVAE.
This is not a different model. DAVAE is HAQAE.
